# restaurant-page
This demo restaurant page uses ES6 modules and factory functions to import and export site functionality spread across multiple javascript files. Webpack is used to bundle source files and other assets and manage entry points and outputs to a distrobution file where index.html is generated. Webpack is managed with a customized webpack.config.js file and the project's package.json file configures package dependencies. This project has CSS layouts for multiple devices for accessiblity and aesthetic responsivness at varying screen widths.
