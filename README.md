# restaurant-page
This demo restaurant page uses ES6 modules and factory functions to import and export site functionality that is spread across multiple javascript files. It uses Webpack to bundle files and other assets and manage entry points and outputs. Webpack is managed with a custom webpack.config.js file and the project's package.json file configures dependencies. This project has CSS layouts for multiple devices for accessiblity and asethic responsivness at varying screen widths.
